A modern client SDK for interacting with the **Dropsy Airdrop Protocol** on Solana, built with:

- ‚úÖ TypeScript
- ‚öôÔ∏è [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) for fast bundling
- üîÄ Dual CJS (`require`) and ESM (`import`) support
- üì¶ Auto-generated type declarations

## üö® Important Notes

## Features

üöÄ Controller ‚Äì The Heart of Your Airdrop Platform
One of the most exciting parts of our protocol is the Controller.

A Controller acts as the foundation for creating and managing airdrops. By initializing your own controller, you can build a fully self-managed airdrop platform ‚Äî and alse earn protocol fees from all the airdrops created using it.

What is a Controller?
A Controller is a special on-chain account that:

Registers ownership over a set of airdrops.

Collects protocol-level fees.

Allows anyone to create token airdrops under your control.

Why Use a Controller?

üí∏ Monetize: Earn fees from every airdrop created using your controller.

üõ†Ô∏è Customize: Tailor your airdrop platform around it.

üåê Permissionless: Anyone can initialize a controller and start building.

How to Initialize a Controller :

```bash
import * as dropsy from "@dropsy/airdrop";

// Create the instruction to initialize your controller
const ix = await dropsy.getInitializeControllerInstructionAsync({
authority: wallet, // the owner of the controller (the signer )
feeLamports: BigInt(5000), // The fee lamports others will pay when c using your controller
});
```

Get initialize airdrop instruction :

```bash
import * as dropsy from "@dropsy/airdrop";

// Create the instruction to initialize your controller
const ix = dropsy.getInitializeAirdropInstructionAsync({
    authority: wallet,   // signer (airdrop creator)
    mint: mint,       // token mint address
    controller: controller,     // controller ( fee collector )
    merkleRoot: merkleRootArray,    // merkle root as an array where all eligible wallets with amount
    startsTime: null,  // BigInt(.....)   // time when the airdrop will start (default is now )
    endTime: null,   // BigInt(.....)    // time when the airdrop will end (default is after 60 days  )
});
```

checkout the init-airdrop.ts in the examples folder to discover how to create merkleRoot
